    <h3>Before I start listing my favorite products, here are a few things <!-- introducing myself and what i look for in makeup -->
       I look for in a makeup product that I want to use everyday</h3>
    <ul> <!-- creating a bulleted list of what i look for in makeup -->
     <li>Afforable: I buy majoritiy of my make up on sale. If I buy a higher end <!-- the bullet points -->
     product, I like to make sure it'll last me a long time. I believe that there are so many hidden gems in the drugstore.</li>
     <li>Inclusive Shade range: As a dark skin black girl, finding products that
     flatter my skin tone is super important. Everyone deserves to have a product that works for them</li>
     <li>Long Wearing: I don't like having to retouch my face throughout the day
     and as a student, especially in the middle of a pandemic where facemasks are worn, longevity is key. </li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Here Are A Few of My Go To Products!</h1> <!-- I will be adding a picture of each item, linking it, and listing my favorite parts of the product-->
   <h2><a href="href="https://www.sephora.com/product/beyond-perfecting-foundation-concealer-P393325?skuId=2166924&icid2=products%20grid:p393325:product"">Clinique Beyond Perfecting Foundation + Concealer</a></h2>
   <img src="images\foundation.jpg" alt="clinique foundation"  width="400" height="500"> <!-- resizing the image so it fits better -->
   <p>I absolutely LOVE this foundation! It's $31, which is pretty afforable for a
   department store foundation. Here are a few highlights</p>
   <ul>
     <li>It has a medium coverage that can be made to full coverage</li>
     <li>The finish is very natural, leaning towards a satin finish</li>
     <li>It has <b>40 shades</b> so it's super inclusive</li> <!-- bolding  -->
     <li>I love the applicator, make it super easy to spot treat and your hands won't get that messy with foundation</li>
   </ul>
   <h2><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/pro-filt-r-instant-retouch-setting-powder-P88779810?icid2=you%20may%20also%20like:p88779810:product&skuId=2173656">Fenty Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Setting Powder </a></h2>
   <img src="images\powder.jpg" alt="fenty powder foundation"  width="400" height="500">
   <p>I'm a huge fan of Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, but this powder in the shade nutmeg is one of my favorites. Heres why:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Lovley matte finish, but it's not drying like some powders</li>
     <li>While it is not drugstore priced ($32) A little goes a LONG way. I have had this powder
     for almost two years and i haven't even used a fifth of the product!</li>
     <li>There is an excellent shade selection. Rihanna <b>NEVER</b> misses when it comes to inclusion</li>
     <li>passes the flash test! no need to worry about looking like this :/</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Lets talk Highlighters!: Maybelline & Wet N Wild</h2> <!-- the highlighters section-->
   <img src="images\highlighter-maybe.jpg" alt="maybelline master chrome highlighter"  width="400" height="500" >
   <img src="images\highlighters.jpg" alt="wet n wild megaglo highlighter"  width="400" height="500">
   <p>I absolutely love the <a href="https://www.ulta.com/facestudio-master-chrome-metallic-highlighter?productId=xlsImpprod16211169&_requestid=14892441
">Maybelline Master Chrome Highlighter</a> in <i>"molten gold"</i> and <a href="https://www.wetnwildbeauty.com/megaglotm-highlighting-powder.html">Wet N Wild Mega Glo Highlighter </a>
in <i>"awesome blossom"</i>
   There was a time when it was SO hard to find nice drugstore highlighters, I'm so glad the drugstre has elevated their game, because I was not ready to spend $40 on a highlighter
    here are a few pros of these two:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Maybelline highlighter is super bright and intense, I love using it as a nose highlight. </li>
      <li>The Wet N wild highlighter can be very natural and also very intense if you want it to be. It's very buldable.</li>
      <li>Both of these brands has an amazing color selection that caters to fair skin and dark skin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/gloss-bomb-universal-lip-luminizer-P67988453?skuId=2327245">Fenty Gloss Bomb</a></h2>
    <img src="images\hot chocolit.jpg" alt="fenty gloss bomb"  width="400" height="500">
    <p>Although it is expensive ($18) the Fenty Beauty Gloss bomb is such a great product to treat yourself with!
       Rihanna has done a great job and creating a color selection where everyone can
    have their own perfect nude. My favorite is Hot Chocolit, it's the perfect nude for me. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It gives you the "wet" look and stays glossy for a long time. </li>
      <li>The way it shimmers on the lips is perfect. Not to gritty, just the perfect amount of shine and glow.</li>
      <li>Moisturizing formula.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now Let's talk Eyeshadow!</h2>
